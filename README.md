# Urban-Flooding
An ML model to redict urban flooding occurrences using available environmental data. This project provides an interactive interface and predictive modeling code that helps estimate flood risk in urban settings — a critical step toward understanding and mitigating impacts of urban flooding.

## 🚀 Features

### 🌀 Flood Prediction Model
Implements code (e.g., in main.py) to analyze and model flooding risk.

### 📊 Interactive Application
Uses app.py (likely with a web interface) to provide prediction outputs to users.

### 📁 Dataset Included
Includes flood.csv, which stores data used for training/testing predictions.

### 🧠 Modular Python Scripts
Separate scripts promote clear organization — model logic in main.py and interface logic in app.py.

## 🛠️ Requirements
Make sure the following Python packages are installed:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn flask streamlit matplotlib

## 💻 Running the Application
### 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aryanmandlik12/Urban-Flooding-
cd Urban-Flooding-
### 2. Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn flask streamlit matplotlib
### 3. Run the app
Depending on how the app is intended to run (check your app.py):
With Streamlit
streamlit run app.py
